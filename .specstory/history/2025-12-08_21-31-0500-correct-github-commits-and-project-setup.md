# Correct GitHub commits and project setup (2025-12-08 21:31-0500)

_**User (2025-12-08 03:42-0500)**_

I dont know what happened but I think some of my commits went to the repo in my personal account and some went to the Altitude Marketing organization which is where  the code should live, not my betterbydesign account. I need to make sure all the local files and previous commits are in the altitudemarketing account under my github user. Also update the @README.md with the current project overview and structure. Add the old design systems folder to the gitignore
